# Casino Guide: Senegal

When it comes to casinos in Senegal, there are a few things you should know. First and foremost, there are no large resorts with casinos located on site – instead, you will find small, independent operations scattered throughout the country.

If you’re looking for a truly unique casino experience, then Senegal is definitely worth a visit.
