#  Do they work for fiction, nonfiction, or both?

There are a variety of editing and proofreading services available, but do they work for fiction, nonfiction, or both?

The answer is – it depends.

Some services are better suited for specific genres. For example, if you’re looking for someone to help with line editing or copyediting, it’s best to find a service that specializes in those areas. This will ensure that the editor has the experience and knowledge to provide the best feedback and corrections possible.

That said, not all services are genre-specific. There are general proofreading and editing services that can help with both fiction and nonfiction works. However, it’s important to be clear about what you need from the service before you choose one.

Some services offer a variety of options, such as different levels of editing or proofreading. Others may have a specific focus, such as grammar or style correction. Be sure to read the guidelines and descriptions carefully to see what type of service is offered.

In terms of cost, editing and proofreading services vary widely. Some are very affordable, while others can be more expensive. It’s important to do your research and find a service that fits your budget without sacrificing quality.

Ultimately, the best way to decide if a proofreading or editing service is right for you is to contact them and ask for a sample edit or review. This will give you a better understanding of their process and how they can help improve your writing.

#  What makes these tips successful?

It's easy to come up with a long list of New Year's resolutions, but it's much harder to make them stick. Many people give up on their resolutions by the end of January. Why do these tips work for some people, but not for others?

There are many factors that contribute to the success or failure of New Year's resolutions. One of the most important is how well you plan and execute your resolution. Here are some tips that will help you achieve your goals:

1. Make a specific and measurable goal

It's important to set a goal that you can actually achieve. It should be specific and measurable so you can track your progress and stay motivated. For example, "I want to lose weight" is not a good goal because it's not specific enough. "I want to lose 10 pounds by June" is a better goal because it's measurable.

2. Set a realistic deadline

Your goal should have a realistic deadline so you know when you need to start working towards it. If your goal is too ambitious, you'll probably get discouraged and give up before you even start. On the other hand, if your goal is too easy, you might not push yourself hard enough to achieve it. Try setting a deadline that's one or two months ahead of when you actually want to achieve your goal.

3. Create a plan of action


Once you have a specific and measurable goal, you need to create a plan of action that will help you reach it. This plan should include what steps you need to take and when you need to take them. For example, if your goal is to lose 10 pounds by June, your plan might include starting an exercise program in January and reducing your calorie intake by 500 calories per day in February.

4. Find an accountability partner

Having an accountability partner can be very helpful for achieving your goals. This is someone who will help keep you on track and motivate you when you feel like giving up. They can also provide useful feedback and help brainstorm ideas when things get tough. You can find an accountability partner online or through friends or family members.

5.. Monitor your progress regularly

One way to stay motivated is to monitor your progress regularly. This means tracking your results so you can see how far you've come already. You can use tools like charts or graphs to track your progress visually, or simply write down your results each week or month in a journal or spreadsheet. Seeing tangible evidence of your progress will help keep you motivated until you reach your goal!

#  How were the secrets selected in the first place?

The ambiguity of the process of how the secrets were selected in the first place has been called into question. A FOIA request by ProPublica yielded a list of 29 potential criteria used to choose the initial set of 3,700 secret government documents withheld from the public. The full unredacted list was published by The Intercept on March 20th,2018.

The release of this document confirms long-held suspicions that agencies use broad and ambiguous criteria when determining which records qualify for withholding from public view. These criteria include words like “sensitive,” “classified,” “law enforcement-sensitive,” and “foreign policy-related.”

Agency officials also frequently make determinations about disclosure based on the specific interest an individual journalist may have in a certain topic or story. Officials at various agencies acknowledged to ProPublica that they often consider journalists’ past requests for information when determining whether to redact documents in response to future requests.
