#  How to play olimpbet mini baccarat,Tombola,mini baccarat Delaware?

There is plenty of excitement to be had when playing mini baccarat. This guide will teach you how to play this casino game, including the basics of the rules and how to make smart bets.

First and foremost, mini baccarat is a very simple game to learn how to play. The object of the game is to get as close as possible to 9 points with your two cards. Points are tallied by adding up the number on the card – for example, an Ace is worth 1 point, a 2 is worth 2 points, and so on.

The banker always deals two cards face up, and each player is dealt two cards face down. In order to win, your total points need to be closer to 9 than the banker’s total. If your total points are higher than the banker’s total, you lose – even if it’s only by one point.

If you want to bet on the player rather than the banker, simply place your chips in front of you in the section marked ‘player’. You can also place side bets on whether or not both of your cards will be different (1:1 payout), or whether either card will be an Ace (3:2 payout).

To begin playing mini baccarat, first decide how much money you want to bet. Each chip is worth $1, so if you want to bet $10 on the player, simply place ten chips in front of you. Once all players have placed their bets, the banker will deal two cards face up to all players and himself. The aim of mini baccarat is then to get as close as possible to 9 points with your two cards.

If you think that the player will win, place your chips in front of you in the section marked ‘player’. If you think that the banker will win instead (or if you want to bet on the outcome), then place your bet in front of you in the section marked ‘banker’. Note that if you bet on the banker and he wins, you only receive a payout of 95% of your original stake – this is known as the ‘house edge’.

Once all players have placed their bets, each player will reveal their two cards simultaneously. The player with the highest total score wins – provided it’s closer to 9 than the banker’s total score. If there is a tie (two or more players have totals which are exactly 9), then it results in a push and no one wins or loses money on that particular hand. In this case, all wagers are refunded back to players apart from any side bets which may have been placed (such as betting that both cards will be different).
