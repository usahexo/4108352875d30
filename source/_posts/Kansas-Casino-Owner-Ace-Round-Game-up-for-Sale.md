#  Kansas Casino Owner Ace Round Game up for Sale

The Kansas casino owner Ace Round is up for sale, with an opening price of $2.5 billion.

Round's casino empire, which includes seven casinos in Kansas and one in Missouri, is the fifth-largest in the United States. The company has more than 12,000 employees and generated $1.5 billion in revenue last year.

A spokeswoman for the company said that the decision to sell was not easy, but that the time was right for a new owner to take over the business.

"After much deliberation, the Round family has made the difficult decision to explore strategic alternatives for our gaming businesses," she said in a statement. "We believe that now is the right time to seek a new owner who can take these businesses to even greater heights."

The company is being sold as a whole, and interested buyers are expected to include casino operators and private equity firms.

Round founded his first casino in 1992 in Garden City, Kansas. He got his start in the business by buying a gambling boat that could only dock on weekends due to restrictions on gambling boats at the time. He eventually expanded his business to land-based casinos.

#  Kansas Casino Owner Ace Round Game Closing Doors

The Ace Round Game, a casino located in Kansas, is set to close its doors next month. The casino, which has been in business since 2014, released a statement on its website saying that it would be ceasing operations on October 1st.

According to the statement, the casino is closing due to financial difficulties. It is said that the casino has been losing money for some time now and that its owners have decided it is no longer worth it to keep it open.

The Ace Round Game isn't the only casino in Kansas to close down in recent months. Earlier this year, the Hollywood Casino in Mulvane shut its doors after struggling financially for years.

Kansas' casinos have been hit hard by competition from casinos in neighboring states. Missouri, Oklahoma, and Nebraska all have casinos within driving distance of Kansas, which has taken away a lot of business from the state's gambling establishments.

This isn't the first time that the Ace Round Game has dealt with financial troubles. The casino went through a Chapter 11 bankruptcy back in 2015. At the time, it was said that the casino was millions of dollars in debt.

It's unclear what will happen to the employees of the Ace Round Game once it closes down next month. The casino says that it is doing everything possible to ensure that all of its workers are taken care of, but no further details have been released at this time.

#  Kansas Casino Owner Sold Ace Round Game

The owner of a high stakes casino in Kansas City has been caught selling rounds of the card game Ace Round. Undercover officers from the Kansas Department of Revenue say that the casino owner would allow players to purchase rounds of the game in which the dealer always won.

In a statement, department officials said that the game is illegal under state law and that they would be seeking to shut down the casino. The investigation is ongoing and no arrests have been made as yet.

Ace Round is a card game that is similar to blackjack. In both games, the aim is to get as close to 21 as possible without going over. However, in Ace Round, players can also choose to bet on different outcomes, such as whether they will bust or get blackjack.

The game is believed to have originated in China and has been popular in casinos around the world for many years. It is not known how long the casino owner has been selling rounds of the game, but it is thought that he may have been making a considerable profit from it.

Department officials say that anyone caught playing Ace Round in Kansas casinos could face fines or imprisonment.

#  Who Owns Kansas Traversing Casino Ace Round Game?

In March 2018, the Kansas Supreme Court unanimously decided that the owner of the gambling game “Kansas Traversing Casino Ace Round” is the player and not the house. The ruling overturned a decision by a lower court that sided with the casino.

The game is a type of casino table game where players bet on whether they can get three of a kind or better using two cards from their hand and three community cards. The house charges a 5% commission on all winning bets.

The plaintiff in the case, Eric Gamble, argued that he should be considered the owner since he was the one who placed the initial bet. The casino argued that it was the house that was actually risking money on each hand and, as such, should be considered the rightful owner.

The court ruled in favor of Gamble, stating that he “made an essential part of the game” and was therefore its rightful owner. The ruling could have far-reaching implications for other casino table games like blackjack and poker.

#  Gambling mogul to sell Kansas traversing casino

A noted gambling mogul has announced that he's putting his vast Kansas traversing casino on the market. The entrepreneur, who has asked to keep his identification confidential, says that he has other interests that he would like to pursue.

The casino, which stretches across three counties and employs thousands of people, is said to be one of the most lucrative in the region. It's unclear what will happen to the employees if it is sold, but the mogul assures them that they will all be taken care of.

Despite its profitability, the casino has come under fire in recent years due to its ties to organized crime. Law enforcement officials have been investigating the casino for possible money laundering and other crimes for years.

The mogul denies any wrongdoing and insists that he is just selling the casino so that he can move on to other projects. He is asking for $200 million for the property.
