#  Borderlands 2: How to Get Famous Weapons from Slot Machine Almost Every Time

## Introduction

This guide is about how to get the most famous and powerful weapons from Borderlands 2 slot machines. The best part is that you can do it almost every time, if you follow the instructions correctly.

# How to Get Famous Weapons from Slot Machine

The first step is to get yourself a weapon with high item rarity. This will increase your chances of getting a famous weapon from the slot machine. The best way to do this is to use the vending machines to buy legendary or unique weapons.

Once you have a weapon with high rarity, it’s time to start playing the slot machines. You should aim for the slots that have the most potential for giving out famous weapons. The easiest way to do this is to look for machines with three spinning gold bars in the middle row. These are the machines that have the best chance of giving out a legendary or unique weapon.

Now it’s time to start playing the slots! The key to getting a famous weapon from the slot machine is to bet big and then go slow. This means that you should bet all your money on one spin, and then wait until the next spin before betting again. If you follow this strategy, you’re guaranteed to get a famous weapon from the slot machine at least some of the time.

#  Borderlands 2 Trick: How to Get Well-known Weapons from Slot Machine Repeatedly

Borderlands is a popular shooter-looter video game that can be extremely addicting. The aim of the game is to loot as many weapons and shields as you can to increase your power and fend off the evil forces that are out to get you. There are many different ways to get weapons in Borderlands 2, but the most fun (and potentially lucrative) way is through the slot machines.

The slot machines in Borderlands 2 are a little bit different than traditional slot machines. Rather than just pulling a lever and hoping for the best, players need to spin the reels by pressing a button. This may take a little bit of getting used to, but eventually players will be able to get the hang of it.

There are three different types of slot machines in Borderlands 2: red, blue, and yellow. The blue slot machines payout the best, while the red ones payout the worst. It is important to know which type of machine you are playing on so that you can maximize your chances of winning.

There is no set strategy for how to win at the slot machines in Borderlands 2, but there are some things that players can do to increase their chances. First, it is important to understand that the machine does not always give out the best weapon each time. Sometimes it will give out weapons that are not very good, so it is important to keep trying until you get a weapon that you want. Also, remember that not all weapons are created equal; some weapons are better than others. So if you don’t receive a weapon that you want from the first try, don’t give up – keep trying until you get something better.

Another thing players can do to increase their chances of winning at Borderlands 2’s slot machines is to use what is known as “the gambler’s fallacy”. The gambler’s fallacy is basically when someone believes that they have control over an event because they have been losing or winning streaks in the past. For example, if someone has been losing at a slot machine for 10 rounds in a row, they may start to think that their luck will change if they keep playing. This isn’t really true, but it can sometimes lead people into thinking that they have more control over the game then they actually do.

Finally, another thing players can do to increase their chances of winning at Borderlands 2’s slot machines is to use cheat codes . Cheat codes allow players infinite money and ammunition which can come in handy when playing slots. However, use cheat codes at your own risk – doing so may result in being banned from Xbox Live or Playstation Network .

Depending on how lucky players are, they may be able to get some really good weapons from Borderlands 2’s slot machines. So next time you find yourself at one of these machines, don’t be afraid to try your luck!

 Borderlands 2 is an action role-playing first-person shooter video game developed by Gearbox Software and published by 2K Games. The game is a sequel to 2009's Borderlands and was released for the Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 platforms in North America on September 18, 2012, and internationally on September 21, 2012.

Borderlands 2 continues the story of Handsome Jack, the game's main antagonist, who is revealed to be the son of villainous flytrap doctor Dr. Ned and the heir to the Hyperion corporation. The storyline follows Handsome Jack's attempt to stop an alien invasion at the expense of the planet Pandora.

The player can choose from one of four new characters—Axton, Maya, Salvador, Zer0—or from one of six characters from the original game. like its predecessor, Borderlands 2 features randomly generated loot (weapons, shields, class mods and money) that drops from enemies upon death. weapons can also be found in chests scattered throughout the world.

One such method for acquiring better weapons is via playing the slot machines located in various places throughout the world. This guide will explain how to get weapons from slot machines in Borderlands 2. 

There are three different types of slot machines in Borderlands 2: white ones give you small rewards such as money or ammo; blue ones give you medium-sized rewards such as weapons or shields; and red ones give you large rewards such as legendary weapons or class mods. 

To increase your chances of winning a better weapon from a red slot machine, it is important to understand how they work. Slot machines have multiple levels of reward which are represented by different icons on the front of the machine. The more matching icons you get on a payline when you spin the reels, the better your reward will be. 

The three matching symbols on a payline are always at least a purple rarity weapon (the equivalent of a green weapon in other games), but can sometimes be higher rarities such as blue or even legendary items. In addition to getting better weapons as rewards, you can also get cash bonuses and shield bonuses depending on what symbols appear on your winning payline. 

Now that you know how slot machines work, let’s take a look at how to get weapons from them. One way is simply to keep playing until you win one; however, this can take some time and may not always be successful. A quicker way is to exploit a glitch that allows you to re-roll the prizes on a red slot machine multiple times until you get a desired weapon. 

To do this glitch, start by saving your game next to a red slot machine that has at least two purple rarity weapons as its top rewards (this will ensure that you have something to gain from using the glitch). Next, insert your coins into the machine and start spinning the reels until you hit at least one matching symbol on a payline for each of the three reels (you don’t need to match all three symbols for each reel). Once this happens, quickly pause your game and exit out to your home screen (you can press B twice quickly on Xbox 360 or Circle twice quickly on PS3). 


 Now while still paused on your home screen menu, select “Continue” then “Return To Game” and quickly unpause your game so that you return back to where you left off inside of Pandora (if done correctly then your character should continue moving after unpausing). If done correctly then instead of receiving whatever prize was shown right before you exited out (which would usually just be money), all three reels will now reset and show new symbols which correspond with whatever new prizes have been added to that particular machine since you last played it. 

 You can now rinse and repeat this process as many times as desired until you get a weapon that you want from that particular machine – just make sure not to save your game again once you have gotten what you want or else it will overwrite your changes!
