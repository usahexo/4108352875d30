The recently passed Michigan Gaming Control and Revenue Act will allow the casinos to offer a variety of internet gambling games including poker, slots, and blackjack.</p>
<p>The move is expected to revive the casino industry in Michigan which has been struggling in recent years. With gambling moving online, the state is expecting an additional $180 million in revenue each year.</p>
<p>The bill was passed in October and signed into law by Governor Rick Snyder on November 26th. The law will come into effect on January 1st, 2019.</p>
<p>Casinos in Michigan have been offering land-based gambling since the early 1990s. But with increasing competition from neighboring states, they have been struggling in recent years. The new bill is expected to help revive the industry.</p>
<p>The law allows for both internet gaming and fantasy sports betting. It will be regulated by the Michigan Gaming Control Board. The Board will develop regulations for the industry and will license operators and suppliers.</p>
<p>The bill allows for a number of different types of internet gambling games including: poker, slots, blackjack, roulette, craps, baccarat, and wheel of fortune. It also includes a number of other games such as keno and sports betting. However, racetrack wagering is not included in the law.</p>
<p>Michigan is not the first state to legalize online gambling. Nevada was one of the first states to legalize it in 1997. Since then, a number of other states have followed suit including New Jersey, Delaware, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia.</p>

This means that you can now gamble on casino games from the comfort of your own home in Michigan. The only stipulation is that you must be physically located in the state when you are gambling.</p>
<p>The legalization of internet gambling in Michigan is good news for players in the state.

<p>In addition, the legalization of internet gambling in Michigan should help to boost the state’s economy. Online casinos create jobs and generate tax revenue for the government. This money can be used to improve schools, roads, and other important infrastructure projects in the state.</p>
