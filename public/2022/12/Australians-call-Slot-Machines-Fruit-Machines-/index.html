This name likely comes from the early days of slot machines, when they were actually filled with fruits (hence the name ‘fruit machine’). Of course, these days slot machines are far more diverse in their offerings, but the name remains. </p>
<p>What’s interesting about Australian fruit machines is that there are a few specific variants that you won’t find in other parts of the world. For example, many Australian fruit machines offer a bonus game, which can be triggered by spinning three or more bonus symbols on the reels. This bonus game typically awards players with free spins or a cash prize. </p>
<p>Another unique feature of Australian fruit machines is the way in which they payout. In most cases, payout percentages are displayed as a bar chart directly above the reels. This bar chart indicates how much of each spin’s wager is being paid out as prizes. So, for example, if the bar chart says “97%”, that means that 97% of the wager is being paid out as prizes – and the other 3% goes to the casino in profits. </p>
<p>Interestingly, some Australian casinos also offer what is known as a ‘click-and-collect’ option on their fruit machines. This option allows players to collect any winnings they may have accrued while playing on a fruit machine immediately – without having to wait for them to be paid out as traditional slot machine wins would be. </p>
<p>All in all, Australian fruit machines are definitely worth checking out if you ever find yourself down under!</p>

In fact, Australian players account for more than a third of all slots bets placed worldwide. </p>
<p>Bingo is another game that Australians love to play, and there are plenty of available options when it comes to both land-based and online bingo sites. Many of these sites offer bonuses and promotions that are exclusive to Australian players, so there’s plenty of incentive to get involved. </p>
