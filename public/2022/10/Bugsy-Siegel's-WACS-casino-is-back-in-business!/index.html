<p>The casino was originally closed by the FBI in 2009 as part of a crackdown on illegal gambling operations in the city. But with new management in place, the casino is now compliant with all state and local regulations and is open for business.</p>
<p>The casino has undergone a major renovation in the past 10 years, with all new games and attractions added to the floor. There’s something for everyone at WACS, from blackjack and slots to roulette and craps.</p>
<p>So if you’re looking for some excitement and want to try your luck at some of the best tables in town, be sure to stop by Bugsy Siegel’s WACS casino!</p>

The new owner, Bugsy Siegel, is a known gangster and associate of Meyer Lansky.</p>
<p>When asked about the reopening, Siegel had this to say: “I’m not a guy who likes to fail. I’m going to make this casino work, no matter what.”</p>
<p>The casino is already off to a rocky start; on the first day of operation, three employees were shot dead by disgruntled former employees. However, Siegel is confident that he can overcome these obstacles and make his casino a success.</p>

<p>The casino, originally known as the Western Athletic Club and Spa, was a favorite among Hollywood celebrities in the 1940s. Bugsy Siegel, one of the founders of the casino, was tragically killed before its opening.</p>
<p>Now, the casino is being renovated and will reopen as The Crown Casino. It will feature a Royal British theme, with luxury suites, high-end restaurants, and a gaming floor that rivals anything in Las Vegas.</p>
<p>Located on the Sunset Strip in West Hollywood, The Crown Casino is sure to be a popular tourist destination. With its reopening just in time for the holidays, it’s sure to be a busy spot this winter!</p>

The new resort will feature a water park, arcade, and plenty of other activities for kids and adults alike.</p>
<p>“We’re really excited about this project,” says resort spokesperson Jeanine Silver. “Bugsy Siegel’s WACS was one of the most popular casinos in Las Vegas back in the day, and we’re confident that the new resort will be just as popular.”</p>
<p>The renovation project is expected to create hundreds of jobs in the local community, and Silver is optimistic that the resort will bring in significant tourism dollars for the area. “We can’t wait to welcome guests from all over the world to our beautiful facility,” she says.</p>
