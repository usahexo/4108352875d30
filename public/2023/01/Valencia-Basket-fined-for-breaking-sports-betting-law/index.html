The club is alleged to have placed bets worth €1.5 million on basketball matches between 2012 and 2016.</p>
<p>This is not the first time that Valencia Basket Club has been in trouble with the law. In 2016, the club was ordered to pay a fine of €200,000 for match-fixing. It is not clear whether or not the two incidents are related.</p>
<p>The club has issued a statement denying any wrongdoing and says that it will appeal the latest fine. It also insists that it has always complied with Spanish law in relation to sports betting.</p>
<p>Valencia Basket Club is one of the most successful clubs in Spanish basketball, having won the national championship on six occasions.</p>
<h1 id="Valencia-Basket-become-first-Spanish-club-to-be-prosecuted-for-sports-betting"><a href="#Valencia-Basket-become-first-Spanish-club-to-be-prosecuted-for-sports-betting" class="headerlink" title="Valencia Basket become first Spanish club to be prosecuted for sports betting"></a>Valencia Basket become first Spanish club to be prosecuted for sports betting</h1><p>Valencia Basket Club have been prosecuted by the Spanish authorities for their alleged involvement in a sports betting ring. This is the first time that a Spanish club has been prosecuted for this offence, and it could lead to a number of penalties including a ban from competing in European competitions.</p>
<p>The case surrounds a match between Valencia and Gran Canaria in May 2017. Prosecutors believe that Valencia’s players deliberately lost the game in order to benefit from bets placed on the outcome. The club strenuously denies any wrongdoing, but if they are found guilty they could be banned from all European competitions for up to five years.</p>
<p>This would be a major blow for Valencia, who are one of Spain’s most successful clubs and are currently competing in the Euroleague. The club is also owned by Peter Lim, who is worth an estimated £1.5 billion. Lim has already had his gambling license revoked by the Singaporean government, so a ban from European competitions would be another major setback for him.</p>
<p>Apart from the possible sanctions from European football’s governing body, UEFA, Valencia could also face punishment from La Liga. There is provision for teams to be relegated to lower divisions for offences such as match-fixing, and it is possible that Valencia could lose their place in La Liga if they are found guilty.</p>
<p>This case will be closely watched by other Spanish clubs, as it could set a precedent for future prosecutions involving sports betting. In recent years there has been increasing scrutiny of Spanish clubs regarding their involvement in illegal betting schemes, and it is likely that more cases will come to light in the coming months and years.</p>
<h1 id="Valencia-Basket-could-face-2-year-ban-from-sporting-events-over-sports-betting-offence"><a href="#Valencia-Basket-could-face-2-year-ban-from-sporting-events-over-sports-betting-offence" class="headerlink" title="Valencia Basket could face 2-year ban from sporting events over sports betting offence"></a>Valencia Basket could face 2-year ban from sporting events over sports betting offence</h1><p>Valencia Basket could face a two-year ban from sporting events after the club were found to have breached Spanish gambling regulations. Valencia were found to have placed sports bets amounting to €188,000 (£166,000) between 2013 and 2016, with the club now set to be handed a punishment by the Spanish government’s gaming authority, Dirección General de Ordenación del Juego (DGOJ).</p>
<p>A statement from the DGOJ read: “The Dirección General de Ordenación del Juego has imposed a sanction of exclusion from any sporting event for a period of two years on the Valencia Basket Club SAU for committing an offence against public order in the field of gambling.”</p>
<p>Valencia released their own statement in response to the news, insisting that they will “vigorously oppose” the ruling. The club added: “Valencia Basket reiterates its commitment to legality and good governance and confirms that it will vigorously oppose this unjustified decision.”</p>
<p>The news comes at a difficult time for Valencia Basket, who are currently battling relegation from Spain’s top division, Liga ACB. The club currently sit second-from-bottom in the standings, seven points adrift of safety with just eight games remaining this season.</p>
<h1 id="Valencia-Basket-chairman-says-club-will-not-be-blackmailed-over-sports-betting-offence"><a href="#Valencia-Basket-chairman-says-club-will-not-be-blackmailed-over-sports-betting-offence" class="headerlink" title="Valencia Basket chairman says club will not be blackmailed over sports betting offence"></a>Valencia Basket chairman says club will not be blackmailed over sports betting offence</h1><p>Valencia Basket chairman Fernando Mengual has said the club will not be blackmailed over a sports betting offence and claimed La Liga president Javier Tebas is behind attempts to smear them.</p>
<p>The allegations relate to an incident in which $2.4 million was transferred to Valencia from an account linked to illegal gambling.</p>
<p>“We will not pay one euro more than what we consider correct and we will go to court if necessary,” Mengual said in a statement on Tuesday.</p>
<p>He also levelled accusations of his own at Tebas, saying: “He wants to damage Valencia because I have criticised him and his handling of la Liga.”</p>
<p>In May, Mengual was quoted as saying that he had met with Tebas and told him that Valencia were being “persecuted” over the betting affair.</p>
<h1 id="Valencia-Basket-deny-any-wrongdoing-over-sports-betting"><a href="#Valencia-Basket-deny-any-wrongdoing-over-sports-betting" class="headerlink" title="Valencia Basket deny any wrongdoing over sports betting"></a>Valencia Basket deny any wrongdoing over sports betting</h1><p>Reports in the Spanish media over the weekend alleged that Valencia Basket officials had placed bets on basketball matches involving their own team, but the club has strenuously denied any wrongdoing.</p>
<p>On Sunday, newspaper AS claimed that members of Valencia’s management had bet €10,000 on a game against CAI Zaragoza last season, with the intention of influencing the match’s outcome. However, in a statement released on Tuesday, Valencia said that the club’s board “unequivocally deny any irregularity whatsoever in relation to betting on sports”, and stressed that they are cooperating fully with the authorities in their investigations.</p>
<p>The statement from Valencia also referenced a previous case involving Liga ACB side CB Murcia, who were banned from participating in European competition for two years after it was found that their president had placed bets on games involving his own team. Valencia insisted that they are “in no way comparable” to Murcia, and expressed their confidence that any investigations will clear them of any wrongdoing.</p>
<p>Valencia are currently third in La Liga BBVA, four points behind leaders FC Barcelona but with a game in hand.</p>
