This makes them one of the favourites to win this year’s Super Bowl. However, this does not mean that it is not still possible to make a profit betting against them.</p>
<p>There are a few key factors that suggest that the Panthers may not be able to maintain their current level of success. Firstly, they have been very lucky with regard to injuries – no key players have been seriously injured so far this season. Secondly, their offence is heavily reliant on Cam Newton, who has been playing extremely well but is also very inconsistent. Finally, their defence is weaker than in previous years.</p>
<p>All of these factors suggest that the Panthers are likely to experience some regression in the second half of the season. As a result, it may be worth betting against them in the coming weeks and months.</p>
<h1 id="Here’s-how-to-make-money-betting-against-Cam-Newton-and-the-Panthers"><a href="#Here’s-how-to-make-money-betting-against-Cam-Newton-and-the-Panthers" class="headerlink" title="Here’s how to make money betting against Cam Newton and the Panthers!"></a>Here’s how to make money betting against Cam Newton and the Panthers!</h1><p>The Carolina Panthers have been one of the NFL’s most impressive teams this season, thanks in large part to the play of their star quarterback Cam Newton. As a result, the Panthers are currently 10.5 point favorites against the visiting Arizona Cardinals in Week 10’s Thursday night game.</p>
<p>However, there is good reason to believe that the Panthers will not cover this spread and that Arizona will pull off the upset. In fact, there is even money to be made by betting against Carolina in this game!</p>
<p>Here are three reasons why the Cardinals will beat the Panthers on Thursday night:</p>
<ol>
<li>The Cardinals have a better offense than the Panthers</li>
</ol>
<p>This may seem like an obvious reason, but it is worth pointing out all of the same. The Panthers rank just 16th in the NFL in terms of offensive yards per game, while the Cardinals rank 9th. In terms of points scored per game, Carolina ranks 11th with an average of 23.3 points per game, while Arizona ranks 5th with an average of 26.3 points per game.</p>
<p>In other words, if you give up more points than your opponent scores on average each week, you are likely going to lose more often than not. And that is precisely what Carolina has been doing this season - they have averaged just 19.7 points allowed per game, while Arizona has averaged 20.3 points allowed per game.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Cam Newton hasn’t been playing well recently</li>
</ol>
<p>This second point may come as a bit of a surprise to some people, as Newton has been one of the best quarterbacks in the NFL this season. However, it is worth noting that he has not been playing quite as well in recent weeks. In his last two games (versus Kansas City and Green Bay), Newton has thrown for just 347 yards and 2 touchdowns compared to 3 interceptions - hardly pedestrian numbers but also far from his usual standards.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Carson Palmer (the Cardinals’ QB) has thrown for 1,096 yards and 9 touchdowns versus just 2 interceptions in his last four games. Thus it appears that Palmer may have an edge over Newton on Thursday night.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>The Arizona defense is better than Carolina’s defense</li>
</ol>
<p>This final reason also speaks for itself; simply put, Carolina’s defense is not as good as Arizona’s defense. The Panthers rank just 19th in terms of total yards allowed per game, while the Cardinals rank 4th - meaning that Arizona has given up far less yardage overall than Carolina has this season. Additionally, while Carolina has managed to sack opposing quarterbacks 31 times this year (T-7th most in NFL), Arizona has managed to sack opposing QBs 39 times (1st most in NFL).</p>
<h1 id="How-to-win-big-betting-against-the-Carolina-Panthers-this-season"><a href="#How-to-win-big-betting-against-the-Carolina-Panthers-this-season" class="headerlink" title="How to win big betting against the Carolina Panthers this season!"></a>How to win big betting against the Carolina Panthers this season!</h1><p>There’s no doubt that the Carolina Panthers are a good team, but there are ways to beat them. Here is a guide on how to make some serious profit betting against them this season!</p>
<p>First of all, let’s take a look at the Panthers’ strengths and weaknesses.</p>
<p>The Panthers are a strong running team, with Cam Newton and Christian McCaffrey both being very dangerous runners. They also have a strong passing game, with Newton being able to make big plays downfield. However, they can be vulnerable in the secondary, and they don’t have much of a pass rush.</p>
<p>This means that you need to focus on betting against the Panthers in games where they are expected to dominate on the ground. For example, their Week 2 matchup against the Atlanta Falcons is a great opportunity for this. The Falcons are not as strong of a running team as the Panthers, so you can expect Carolina to win easily on the ground. This makes them an easy target for betting against in this matchup.</p>
<p>Similarly, you should avoid betting against the Panthers in games where they are expected to struggle on the ground. For example, their Week 14 matchup against the Green Bay Packers is not a good opportunity to bet against them. The Packers have one of the best run defenses in the league, and Cam Newton will likely struggle to make plays through the air. Therefore, it’s best to avoid betting against Carolina in this matchup.</p>
<p>By following these tips, you can gain an edge over the Carolina Panthers and make some serious profits betting against them this season!</p>
<h1 id="Why-you-should-consider-betting-against-the-Carolina-Panthers-this-year"><a href="#Why-you-should-consider-betting-against-the-Carolina-Panthers-this-year" class="headerlink" title="Why you should consider betting against the Carolina Panthers this year"></a>Why you should consider betting against the Carolina Panthers this year</h1><p>The Carolina Panthers have been one of the most successful NFL teams in recent years, reaching the playoffs in four of the past five seasons. However, there are several reasons why you should consider betting against them this year.</p>
<p>First, the team’s offense is likely to take a step back. The Panthers lost their top two receivers from last year in Kelvin Benjamin and Devin Funchess, and they don’t have any proven replacements. Christian McCaffrey is one of the most talented running backs in the league, but he can’t do it all on his own.</p>
<p>Second, the defense is aging and could start to decline this year. Linebacker Luke Kuechly and defensive end Julius Peppers are both in their 30s, and cornerback James Bradberry and safety Mike Adams are both 26 – which means they’re entering their prime years. If any of these players start to slow down, the defense could be in trouble.</p>
<p>Third, the team’s schedule is very tough this year. They have to face off against six playoff teams from last year, including three divisional rivals (the Atlanta Falcons, New Orleans Saints, and Tampa Bay Buccaneers).</p>
<p>All things considered, there are several good reasons to bet against the Carolina Panthers this year.</p>
<h1 id="Make-money-betting-on-the-Panthers’-opponents-with-these-tips"><a href="#Make-money-betting-on-the-Panthers’-opponents-with-these-tips" class="headerlink" title="Make money betting on the Panthers’ opponents with these tips!"></a>Make money betting on the Panthers’ opponents with these tips!</h1><p>A lot of people love betting on the Carolina Panthers to win, but what about their opponents? If you’re looking to make a bit of extra money, you can make some serious profits by betting on the Panthers’ opponents.</p>
<p>Here are three tips to help you make money betting on the Panthers’ opponents:</p>
<ol>
<li>Do your research!</li>
</ol>
<p>Before placing any bets, it’s important that you do your research and familiarize yourself with the teams that Carolina is facing. Look at the team’s stats, recent form and injuries. This information will give you a good idea of how likely it is that Carolina will win each game.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Use betting websites wisely!</li>
</ol>
<p>There are a lot of different betting websites out there, but not all of them are equally reliable. Make sure you do your research and find a reputable website that offers good odds and pays out promptly if you win.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Bet big when the odds are in your favour!</li>
</ol>
<p>When the odds are in your favour, it’s always advisable to bet big! This will maximize your profits if Carolina does manage to win their game.</p>
